# Arcade-System
This is a Arcade database project based on this mini-world scenario: A new arcade about to open up is charging people by the hour for any game they would like to play, in this they are implementing a new system for their members access cards. Each member can hold onto minutes they havenâ€™t used by checking in/out when entering or leaving the arcade, this also includes a limited amount of data in which they can store saved progress in certain games. The arcade requires a database to track which user is who, how many minutes that user has and any saved progress data that user has stored.
